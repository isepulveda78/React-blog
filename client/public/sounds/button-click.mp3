// This file needs to be replaced with an actual MP3 file
// Since I can't generate audio files, you have several options:

// Option 1: Download free sounds from:
// - freesound.org (search "button click")
// - zapsplat.com (free tier available)
// - mixkit.co (free sound effects)

// Option 2: Use Web Audio API beeps (already working)
// The useSound hook includes built-in beep sounds that work without files

// Option 3: Record your own sounds
// Use any audio recording software to create short click sounds
